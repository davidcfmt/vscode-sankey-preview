# Security Review Report

## VS Code Marketplace Security Compliance

This extension has undergone a comprehensive security review and implements the following security measures:

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- ✅ **Input Size Limits**: Maximum 100KB text input to prevent DoS attacks
- ✅ **Node Name Sanitization**: Node names limited to 100 characters with XSS character removal
- ✅ **Numeric Validation**: Strict validation of numeric values (positive, finite numbers only)
- ✅ **String Validation**: All text inputs validated for type and content

### Content Security Policy (CSP)
- ✅ **Tightened CSP**: Removed `unsafe-eval` and `unsafe-inline` directives
- ✅ **Local Resources Only**: All scripts and resources served from extension bundle
- ✅ **No External Requests**: Zero network requests, fully offline operation

### XSS Prevention
- ✅ **Input Sanitization**: HTML/JS injection characters (`<>\"'&`) removed from user input
- ✅ **Safe DOM Updates**: Uses controlled innerHTML with static content only
- ✅ **Quoted Name Support**: Secure parsing of quoted node names without injection risks

### Debug & Information Disclosure
- ✅ **No Debug Output**: All `console.log` statements removed from production code
- ✅ **Graceful Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages without system information leakage
- ✅ **No Stack Traces**: Error messages sanitized to prevent information disclosure

### File Security
- ✅ **Local File Access Only**: Extension only accesses workspace files through VS Code API
- ✅ **No File Writes**: Extension is read-only, no file system modifications
- ✅ **Sandboxed Execution**: All code runs within VS Code's security sandbox

### Library Security
- ✅ **Trusted Libraries**: Uses established D3.js and d3-sankey libraries
- ✅ **Local Bundling**: All dependencies bundled locally, no CDN requests
- ✅ **Version Pinning**: Specific library versions to prevent supply chain attacks

### VS Code Integration Security
- ✅ **API Compliance**: Uses only documented VS Code extension APIs
- ✅ **Webview Security**: Implements secure webview communication patterns
- ✅ **Activation Events**: Minimal activation footprint for security
