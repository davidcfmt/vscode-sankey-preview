# Security Review Report

## VS Code Marketplace Security Compliance

This extension has undergone a comprehensive security review and implements the following security measures:

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- ✅ **Input Size Limits**: Maximum 100KB text input to prevent DoS attacks (configurable)
- ✅ **Node Name Sanitization**: Node names limited to 100 characters with XSS character removal
- ✅ **Numeric Validation**: Strict validation of numeric values (positive, finite numbers only)
- ✅ **String Validation**: All text inputs validated for type and content
- ✅ **Link Count Limits**: Maximum 5000 links to prevent memory exhaustion
- ✅ **Node Count Limits**: Maximum 1000 nodes to prevent memory exhaustion

### Content Security Policy (CSP)
- ✅ **Secure CSP**: Removed `unsafe-eval` and `unsafe-inline` directives
- ✅ **Local Resources Only**: All scripts and resources served from extension bundle
- ✅ **No External Requests**: Zero network requests, fully offline operation
- ✅ **Script Source Restriction**: Only allows scripts from webview CSP source

### XSS Prevention
- ✅ **Input Sanitization**: HTML/JS injection characters (`<>\"'&`) removed from user input
- ✅ **Safe DOM Updates**: Uses controlled innerHTML with static content only
- ✅ **HTML Escaping**: All user-provided content properly escaped before DOM insertion
- ✅ **Quoted Name Support**: Secure parsing of quoted node names without injection risks

### File Security
- ✅ **Local File Access Only**: Extension only accesses workspace files through VS Code API
- ✅ **Export Validation**: File format and size validation for exports
- ✅ **Path Validation**: Proper file path handling with error boundaries
- ✅ **Sandboxed Execution**: All code runs within VS Code's security sandbox

### Error Handling & Information Disclosure
- ✅ **Graceful Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks throughout
- ✅ **User-Friendly Messages**: Error messages sanitized and user-friendly
- ✅ **No Debug Output**: No sensitive information in error messages
- ✅ **Error Boundaries**: Global error handling for webview crashes

### Library Security
- ✅ **Trusted Libraries**: Uses established D3.js and d3-sankey libraries
- ✅ **Local Bundling**: All dependencies bundled locally, no CDN requests
- ✅ **Version Pinning**: Specific library versions to prevent supply chain attacks

### VS Code Integration Security
- ✅ **API Compliance**: Uses only documented VS Code extension APIs
- ✅ **Webview Security**: Implements secure webview communication patterns
- ✅ **Activation Events**: Minimal activation footprint for security
- ✅ **Configuration Security**: Secure configuration handling with validation

   - Verified proper HTML escaping
   - Confirmed safe DOM manipulation

4. **Error Handling Testing**
   - Verified no sensitive information in error messages
   - Confirmed graceful degradation for all error cases
   - Tested parser with malformed input

5. **File Security Testing**
   - Confirmed secure file export operations
   - Verified path validation and sanitization
   - Tested file size and format validation

6. **Network Security Testing**
   - Confirmed zero external network requests
   - Verified all resources served locally
